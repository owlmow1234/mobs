All mobs will be tameable. Therefore, you can name every mob.
All aggressive mobs will then attack all other mobs and will hold weapons other than the default bow or hands.
All passive mobs can be sheared for their meat or wool without dying and will give more experience when they do die.
Cows, pigs, horses, and donkeys will give leather and meat when sheared, as do rabbits and sheep and chickens give off their respective items.
NPC can equip armour and swords, once fed bread until tame.  They will make you chain armour.
One piece of chain (one chain is equivalent to one leather, one diamond, etc.)is made from two stone and one iron ingot.
Having a zombie or a NPC with you on a leash will detract witches, and they will throw all potions at themsleves (the witches), and not you.
Bows are inoperable by a NPC unless enchanted
All arrows with smite 1-5 will not damage you with NPC- chain
Horses with foals can not die from a sword lower than diamond, or an arrow from a bow unless both are enchanted (arrow and bow).
